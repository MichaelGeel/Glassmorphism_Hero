                <h1>The Countryside</h1>
                <p>It's a dream of mine, to be able to kick my feet up in front of a warm fire, sipping a good cup of coffee as I look out at the rolling green hills of the countryside before me.</p>
                <p>The peace, the calm, the quiet. It instills in one a sense that things aren't so bad after all. I hope to be fortunate enough to call such a beautiful sight my own one day.</p>
